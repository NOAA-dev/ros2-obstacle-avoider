# ROS 2 Obstacle Avoider (Gazebo Simulation)

## Overview
This repository implements a **reactive obstacle avoidance system** for a custom differential-drive robot using **ROS 2**, **Gazebo Sim**, and **LiDAR perception**.

The focus is on **behavior-based robotics**, using sector-based spatial reasoning instead of global planning.

## Key Features

- Custom differential-drive robot
- GPU LiDAR sensor with noise model
- Sector-based obstacle perception
- Continuous steering control
- Deadlock handling in cluttered environments
- Empirically tuned parameters
- Custom obstacle-dense Gazebo world

## Obstacle Avoidance Strategy

### LiDAR Sectorization
The LiDAR scan is divided into:
- **Left sector**
- **Front sector**
- **Right sector**

Each sector computes the **minimum valid range**, allowing robust spatial reasoning even with noisy data.

---

### Control Logic

- If front sector is clear → move forward
- If obstacle detected ahead:
  - Compare left and right clearance
  - Steer toward the side with more free space
- If clearance is similar:
  - Slow forward motion with forced rotation to escape deadlock

Angular velocity is proportional to the difference between left and right distances, enabling smooth steering.
